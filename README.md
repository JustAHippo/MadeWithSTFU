# MadeWithSTFU
Gets rid of the Made With Unity screen

## Usage
Select the root Unity build directory and type the exact unity Version you use, for example `2022.3.33f1`

I would not recommend using this in any published projects because I do not know anything about legality.
## Building

To build a redistributable, production mode package, use `wails build`.

## About
This project was made to test Wails Go UI, would recommend :)
